# First slide
- displaying all bullets at once
- here's a second bullet
- and a third 

???
here are some speaker notes, to make sure you don't forget to talk about all three bullets. 
---
# Second slide
- Now we're going to do incremental slides
--

- so this second bullet should be hidden at first

???
there are speaker notes here, but they shouldn't be seen on the first bullet, only when on the second. 
---
# Third slide
- another incremental slide
???
This time, we want the speaker notes to show up for the entire slide though, not just once all the increments have been revealed. 
--

- second bullet, this one is incremental
???
I'm testing to see if adding notes here over-rides the first bullet notes, or if it amends it. 
--

- third bullet, also incremental. the speaker notes should have been visible for all of these though.
